## AWS Industrial Time Series Data Connector on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start deploys the AWS Industrial Time Series Data Connector into your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. The Industrial Time Series Data Connector synchronizes your on-premises systems to AWS to enable advanced analytics on your industrial process time series data. 

You can deploy the connector from your own AWS account in less than an hour. After deployment, you can establish near real-time managed feeds for selected data, get your data to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), keep it current, and explore and analyze your data with AWS analytics services such as Amazon Elasticsearch (Amazon ES) with Kibana and Amazon Kinesis.

The Industrial Time Series Data Connector also provides optional integration with the AWS IoT service, where your data is processed by the AWS IoT gateway and can be routed to other AWS services by the AWS IoT rules engine. 

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying AWS Industrial Time Series Data Connector into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying AWS Industrial Time Series Data Connector into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
